  <p>Rails UI themes represent a collection of design patterns put to use. You can use them as is or tweak a theme using the combined design system to extend your application further.</p>

  <p>Due to the unique nature of any given application, themes are incomplete by design however you may leverage them to fast-forward the design process on additional views that don't already exist inside your application.</p>

  <h3>Easy editing</h3>

  <p>Because everything is integrated to your application you can freely edit any CSS and customize colors, typography, components, and more.</p>

  <p>Rails UI configuration steps are extremely simple thus making customization later limitless.</p>

  <p>Because we can't predict every view you will need in the future we start with the basics with regards to more common pages many applications need.</p>

  <h3>What's in a given theme?</h3>

  <p>A theme consists of pre-built views (optional), common UI components, and a design system. Combine the two and you have professionally designed application ready for scale.</p>

  <p>As Rails UI evolves, an additional series of optional views and more advanced components will accompany each theme. This will save a bunch of time and effort for those not already savvy with design.</p>

  <h3>Post-install</h3>

  <p>After installing a theme you cannot change it using the Rails UI configuration editor. If you decide would like to change themes or go a different direct it's best start with a fresh Rails application.</p>
